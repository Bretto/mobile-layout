            <h3>Online / Offline Capabilities</h3>

            <p>
                The mobile application needs to be able to

            <h3>Deep-Linking</h3>

            <p>
                The user would be able to send a URL pointing a particular resources in the app, and the receiver would
                open the app a that location on clicking on a link.
            </p>

            <h3>Hot-Fixes and Version Controls</h3>
            <p>
                In the case of a critical bug in the app, a mechanisms is available to push a "hot-fix", additionaly we have a way of pushing updates.

            <h3>Data Mining</h3>
            <p>

            <h2>View</h2>

            <h3>Component Toolkit</h3>

            <p>A rich list and echo system of reusable components needs to be available for the developement of mobile
                apps.</p>
            <h4>Notes</h4>

            <h3>Multi Platform Deployments</h3>

            <p>By using the "Web Technologies" (Html, CSS, JS) we will access to the long dream of 'Write Once, Deploy
                Everywhere".</p>
            <h4>Platform of Deployments</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>Rich and Responsive User Experience</h3>

            <h3>Deep Integration with Device OS</h3>

            <p>It is required that the mobile app has access to many (potentially all) features provided by the device

            <h3>Test Test Test</h3>
            <p>The Mobile apps should be coming with a test suite.</p>

            <h3>Deployments and Version Control</h3>
            <p>New release of apps should be published by a deploy script. (concatenation, minification, obfuscation)</p>
